# Lets create a New Zealand GovTech Licence

## Context
New Zealand has booming IT sector, providing jobs to over 100,000 Kiwis. We kiwis are proud of this and are getting behind it. Our public and private sector are starting to promote and position New Zealand to be on as a thought leader in IT. Our startup scene is robust and booming. Further We are cultivating a strong ecosystem of social entrepanuers working on to build businesses that make a difference. 

I have recently had the privaledge to take my business - rootsystems.nz through the Government sponsored R9 accelerator working on the challenge "Do it for the kids" with the Ministry of Education. R9 is a unique GovTech accelerator where teams sponsored by a ministry to work on government problems and the government takes no equity in the business. We have put together a solution in partnership with loomio called Tapin - providing decision making and procurement tools and training. 

I have learned so much from all the wonderful hard working profesionals in our Educaiton sector - most importantly I have learned that change at a national scale is hard. Its not good enough to build tools and let them out into the wild, you have to work with the stakeholders and customer segments to provied change management, guidance and conviction.

Root Systems and Loomio both currently release our source code under GNU Affero General Public License and are committed to upholding the ideals of opensource in principle and in practice. In working on the business development of Tapin I have had to both defend being opensource and explain the business model and risk management many times. Those who don't understand this, advise the use of closed source as the best policy and we are seeing many startups default to this.


It was after one of these conversations in August 2017 that I started to think about our strategy of open source, Mikey Williams and I had had several excited conversations about a participatory opensource licence - one where those who contribute to the code base recieve a licence to use the software while other non-contributors have buy a licence. This would still be underpinned by the availability of a non-commercial licence. In principal this can be thought of as creating groups that recieve different licences. We were very inspired when we came across licensezero.com - "a shot across the bow of Open Source software entitlement, free-as-in-worthless, and maintainer disposability". What if we could use this for the new software we were building with support of the Ministry of Education? - What if all R9 teams used a participatory open source licence?

## A case for a new type of open source licence
Over the last few decades we have seen information technology disrupt the status quo of sector after sector. In the last few years this has been very focused on the social networking and media space, now we are seeing businesses, startups and politicians looking to bring the same healthy disruption to our government infrastructure and processes. This is a worldwide movement and is a multi billion dollar market.

In Wellington we are seeing the emergance of a healthy ecosystem where Tax dollars and Calahagn innovation are spent supporting R&D startups through the R9 Accelerator. This has two fantastic outcomes:

 - We are investing in entrepanuers
 - We are bootstrapping new businesses

Further the established businesses are getting behind these startups, providing critical advice and networknig to help them scale up. These GovTech startups will grow up contributing to the economy and helping local and national governments deliver better value to their citizens.

However we have currently defaulted to a path of creating closed source systems. Healthy competition is good, but is it healthy to have our governments competing on creating the same systems with our tax payer dollars? This is a race to the bottom of wasted resource. Rather Governments should be looking to collaborate on delivering better value for their citizens tax dollars. We can do this by sharing the source code of our GovTech solutions between governments and sharing the improvements that eventuate. The first Government to fund a product benefits later from improvements funded by another.

A consequance of such an approach is the question of how our startups make money. There are three key opportunities:

 - Providing the solution as a service to governments.
 - Retaining commercial rights for the solution. Selling it to businesses.
 - Consulting on customisation work.

The aim here is to strike a balance between making open source solutions that we share and retaining the commercial opportunity for the business. Having the flexibility of deviding our licences by sector or group gives governments and startups the opportunity to scale up faster and deliver better value.

A parrellel to GovTech startups is the social entrepanuership movement. Perhaps supporting GovTech & CivicTech startups to scale and work in an open and collaborative way is getting more people working on stuff that matters. 

## The Opportunity - NZGTL - New Zealand Gov Tech Licence
I live in Wellington - the windy capital of Aotearoa New Zealand. Its an incredibly diverse and windy city! I love it. It also has a booming IT and Film industry which could easily double in the next few years. 

New Zealand has an opportunity to act as a thought leader on the world stage, putting Wellington on the map as a destination for GovTech and CivicTech startups to prosper. And putting New Zealand on the map as the originator of a standard for how governments can work collaboratively with startups in an opensource way.

We are at the beginning of the disruptive GovTech movement - We should invest now in creating a foundation for of collaboration and mutual benefit.
