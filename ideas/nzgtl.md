# Lets create a New Zealand GovTech Licence

## Context
New Zealand has booming IT sector, providing jobs to over 100,000 Kiwis. We kiwis are proud of this and are getting behind it. Our public and private sector are starting to promote and position New Zealand to be on as a thought leader in IT. Our startup scene is robust and booming. Further We are cultivating a strong ecosystem of social entrepanuers working on to build businesses that make a difference. 

I have recently had the privaledge to take my business - rootsystems.nz through the Government sponsored R9 accelerator working on the challenge "Do it for the kids" with the Ministry of Education. R9 is a unique GovTech accelerator where teams sponsored by a ministry to work on government problems, the government takes no equity in the business. We have put together a solution in partnership with loomio called Tapin - providing decision making and procurement tools and training. 

I have learned so much from all the wonderful hard working profesionals in our Educaiton sector - most importantly I have learned that change at a national scale is hard. Its not good enough to build tools and let them out into the wild, you have to work with the stakeholders and customer segments to provied change management, guidance and conviction.

Root Systems and Loomio both currently release our source code under GNU Affero General Public License and are committed to upholding the ideals of opensource in principle and in practice. In working on the business development of Tapin I have had to both defend being opensource and explain the business model and risk management many times. Those who don't understand this, advise the use of closed source as the best policy and we are seeing many startups default to this.


It was after one of these conversations in August 2017 that I started to think about our strategy of open source, Mikey Williams and I had had several excited conversations about a participatory opensource licence - one where those who contribute to the code base recieve a licence to use the software while other non-contributors have buy a licence. This would still be underpinned by the availability of a non-commercial licence. In principal this can be thought of as creating groups that recieve different licences. We were very inspired when we came across licensezero.com - "a shot across the bow of Open Source software entitlement, free-as-in-worthless, and maintainer disposability". What if we could use this for the new software we were building with support of the Ministry of Education? - What if all R9 teams used a participatory open source licence?
