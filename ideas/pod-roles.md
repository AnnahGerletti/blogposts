Our core business is providing development services on projects. We are moving into product development during this year (Cobuy - distributed procurement software). 

Our members receive funds based upon an algorithm:
	Retainer ($3500) + Viability bonus ($500-$2000) + Commission (5-20%)

How much viability bonus and commission a member receives is determined by how long the current runway of the business is. If we have 4 months of runway then it maxes out.

Our typical rate for services is $120 and in the last year we have mostly operated with a 2 month runway. A member's take home was on average:
	$3500 + $1000 + 1200 (10% of 12000) = $5700

Members working on products will receive the retainer and viability bonus but not the commission.

Our organisation aims to be Teal as according to the www.reinventingorganizations.com. We structure ourselves with 3 levels of responsibility/duty:

| Role | No. of Members | Meeting Cadence | Decision Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coordinators | 2 | Weekly | 3 |
| Directorts | 2 | Monthly | 2 |
| Shareholder* | All | Quaterly | 1 |

*Shareholders == Members

Coordinators are responsible for the week to week running of the business, they follow the advice process for making decisions and best judgement to escalate to a consensus decision of the shareholder group. All proposals and commitments to projects need to be signed off by the directors. Coordinators should approach proposals optimistically. The Role rotates every year.
Directors are responsible for legal compliance and risk mitigation. They hold the business plan set out at the shareholder AGM and are responsible for steering the company along it. They have the authority to sign off proposals that are aligned with this and use their best judgement to escalate to a consensus decision of the shareholder group where needed. Directors should approach proposals pessimistically.
Every person in the business is a shareholder. They meet annually to set a business goal list for the year and quarterly to review it. They are the ultimate holders of power within the organisation and all escalations end with the group.
