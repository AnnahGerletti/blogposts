Our business strategy for the our web development services can be divided into three types of contracts:

Lower rate long term contracts 
Higher rate short term contracts
Lower rate social impact contracts

Most of our leads come through referrals, the enspiral network or connecting through our open source activities. 

Long term contracts stabilise our finances, whilst shorter term contracts are more profitable we mainly pursue them for the opportunity of converting them into a long term contract. When we have the opportunity we prioritise social impact work.

However service companies donâ€™t scale, the technical and administrative problems just get bigger requiring ever more specialised staff. That is why we are looking to shift to product in 2017. 

Cobuy is our first product. It is distributed procurement software. Cobuy is fundamentally a coordination tool allowing for:

The Aggregation of group buying power
The reduction in administrative time
More consistent data

It has multiple markets to sell into to. These can be characterised as:

Organisations that already have buying power, but need better coordination. Eg a government department or school

For this market we will charge a fixed licence fee per month

Organisations that need to coordinate their members to gain buying power and need better coordination. Eg a food buying group.

For this market we will charge a low percentage per use

Both of these markets are low growth massively scalable. This therefore requires that we supplement  the early stages with our continued web development service offering.
