# Q & A prep: Interview with Nigel

## What type of company is Root Systems and how did it originate?

Root Systems (RS) is a worker owened limited liability company. We are planning to register as a Co-Operative LLC later this year.

Root Systems emerged from a group of Developer consultants working through Enspiral Dev Academy. Essentially we were nurtured into existance within the infrastructure of Dev Academy. We functioned with complete autonomy and decided to form our own company when our processes and systems started to differ from Dev Academy, resulting in increased admin all round.

We formed out of a desire to work differently, be our own bosses and make our work have meaning and impact on society.

## Why does the company have a UBI?

We have a UBI for much the same positive reasons that are theorised for a national UBI:
ther then rewarding our members for producing
 - Reduction in Admin
 - Simplification of the pay system
 - Increased understandibility
 - Provide security
 - Provide a platform for us to develop a flexible pay algorythm.

### Pay Algorythm

This can be simplified down to:

'''
Universal Basic Income + Business Viability Top up + % commision
'''

## How is this different to a salary + bonus and/or commission?

Both a UBI and salary are an agreement to pay you regardless of what you actually do.

Our commisions are the same, rewarding you for what you actually earn the company (do in our case as we are paid per hour)

Our business viability top up is similar to a performance bonus, except that it is related to how sustainable the company is on any given month rather then abstract targets typically associated with extractable value. We reward our members for succeeding as a whole rather then rewarding our members for producing extractable value.

## Why financial transparency is important to your company and why you think it is more important for future future societies (for more equality?)

Transparency is one of our core group values, as such we default to it wherever possible. Our hypothosis is that transparency is required for self-management.

If you have no transparency into a system how can you start to work in it/improve it? You can't, you can only replace it.

In terms of financial transparency it never occured to us for it not to be transparent. In fact our pay algoryth depends on it as we need to check the calculations monthly as it is a manual error prone process.

Financial transparency allows us to all be aware of the value exchanges that are occurin. Understanding how the finances of the company work is also vitally important to its sustainability. If only one person knows you have a huge risk to the company as a whole.

Our approach to financial transparency can be can be divided into two, public transparency (open for anyone) and internal transparency (for members). Internal financial transparency means we all understand the flows of funds and can validate the system functions as expected and is not unfairly favouring anyone. This is important as we do not wish to waste our emotional energy on tall poppy nonsense. It keeps things fair and spoken.

Public transparency at the moment is about trying to educate others about how and why we structure Root Systems the way we do. And ultimately produce a replicable model that others can adopt.

In the future I see transparency being a valued as part of a value exchange. I am already trying to implement this, last week I was sitting down with a prospective client, speaking about an upcoming project and when asked about rates I got to explain that we would charge $100 an hour for a long term ongoing agile contract and that of this we are breaking even at $70. I then went on to explain how we spend the profit on developing opensource software and our social impact product Cobuy - group buying software.

## How does Root Systems as an organisation work?

Our organisation puts the pod members at the top, then directors and coordinators. Directors and Coordinators are to use there best judgement to pass issues/tasks up to the next level as needed.

Pod Members:
 - Decision making process: Operate with a 100% agreement desision making process derived and heavily inspired and influenced by the peeps at  Loomio.
 - Accountabilities: Everything
 - Rhythm: Meet annually for a retreat and form a business plan for the next year. They then meet quaterly to review and take action on the plan
 - Mindset: Leading by influence, Identifing and taking initiative to lead out on something.

Directors:
 - Decision making process: Advice process, obligation to seek advice, but maintain the authority to make the final call.
 - Accountabilities: Risk Management, tax obligation management, Contracted services management, business plan management and anything else coordinators don't want
 - Rhythm: Meet monthly reviewing project reports and finances.
 - Mindset: Pesimistic

Coordinators:
 - Decision making process: Advice process
 - Accountablities: Run the business day to day, Negociate deals, Account (Client) management, Hold Project managers/owners to account.
 - Rhythm: Meet weekly
 - Mindset: Optimistic

## Why do you think its a complete failure to have someone out of work

I don't, I think its an opportunity. I think its a failure to think its a failure. A group member with time is an opportunity to do something on behalf of the group. Earning money is one such activity, but there are many others. It could be business related things like blogging, skilling up or administration. Or it could be pushing out on a new product or representing the group culturaly, socially or politically.

## Why do you think it is necessary to start reinventing organisations and have the workers earn more of the profits

What is the purpose of an organisation/company? In part it provides a legal shell to operate through where a group may be represented as an individual within our legal structure, it consolidates the responsability of the shell down to a few - the directors, so there are real people who may be held to account for the conduct and/or activities of the group. For the most part it provides an identity and coordination protocol so that the members of the group can conduct the company activities together.

Beyond this organisations have also been used as money mines, entities whos purpose is to extract "money" for an external organisation, individual or state.

It is not wrong to deliver value/money to external entities - quite the opposiete we need this. Taxes are a good example of where we need this for society to work. Returns on investment are another.

The problem is that we have started to think the purpose of business is to produce taxes and returns for the state and rich rather then serving it members - the workers.

We are proposing a new Organisational structure for new companies. And we are proposing that existing organisations see the value in having an egaged workforce, with a real say and skin in the game, and start to reform away from money mines first worker second orgs to worker first money mine second orgs.
